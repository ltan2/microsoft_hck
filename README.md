## Description
This project attempts to create a website that addresses the issue of Africa iliteracy as part of a hackathon challenge.
Differing from common learning websites and applications, we wanted something more that could address immediate pressing problems. Living in harsh conditions,
students are more likely to dropout and work in order to support their families, rather than study. Therefore, we introduce Smart Book, which contains 3 main sections:
resources,education and blank pages. Students are to fill up the blank pages with their own stories; after learning how to write and read from the education sections in
Smart Book. We then compile their stories to be published, for fund raising.

## More details
Due to the time constraint, we were not able to complete it, but we manage to build a very simple prototype out from our idea. Application has yet to be deployed.
