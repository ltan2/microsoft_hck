  <h3>Who we are?</h3>
  <p> We are Team Zero :). This project was created as a submission to Microsoft Hackathon competition. We focus on addressing the
  issue of literacy for Africa, to address the need for the lack of resources and funding for schools. Read on to see how we are making an impact</p>
  <br/><br/>
  <h3>Our Believes</h3>
  <p>The African region is a diverse part of the world, fill with millions of people,with hopes, visions,stories, talents and backgrounds. However, over
  60% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa of children age 15-17 years ols, are out of school. Force to grapple with harsh
  living situations and other issues like poverty and hunger, education is left aside. But, just like you and me,
  we believe everyone deserves an education regardless of their background,race or status. Therefore, the aim of this project is
  to give young people knowledge, tools and resources to share their stories,while also learning and earning to support their living conditions</p>
