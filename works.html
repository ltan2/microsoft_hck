         <p>The book is broken into 3 parts: <br/>
         A. Resources pages : The first few page are dedicated solely to resources around the region where the educators,schools or community are
         so that students who get the book/ ebook know where to find resources,tools and help for their living conditions<br/>
         B. Education pages : Volunteers dedicates the pages to the language, such as introducing new words, pictures and phrases to
         teach and empower students to write and learn<br/>
         C. Blank pages : Students can start writing their own stories, draw or even take pictures to be included in the book<br/>
         </p><br/>

         <h3> THE IMPACT</h3>
        <p> 1. Students ae able to access and learn through remote distancing even if internet is not available as strategy
         can be implemented as an ebook or hard copy book. They have access to the resources and education pages that gives them the idea
         and knowledge to write and learn at the same time<br/>
         2. Students feel motivated to learn. We understand the harsh living conditions many children go through each day, and want to give them the hope
         and empowerment to learn by providing incentives. The resources pages in the book are also meant to help them while they wait for their work to be publish.
         Knowing that their stories will get publish, students will want to learn. They get to share their stories, culture and experiences with the world.
         It also opens a door to future career as writers.<br/>
         3. Students are able to fundraise and earn money themselves <br/>
         4. Readers benefit from reading other live stories , culture and background
